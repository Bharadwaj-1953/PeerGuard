Decentralized Fault Tolerance and <br> Network Partition Detection Framework
</h1>

---

## 📝 Abstract

<div align="justify">

PeerGuard is a decentralized monitoring framework designed to enhance fault tolerance and resilience in distributed systems, especially under conditions of partial network partitioning. The project integrates three lightweight components — heartbeat-based failure detection, traffic monitoring, and node status logging — into a cohesive architecture.

Unlike traditional centralized approaches, PeerGuard distributes responsibilities across peer nodes, eliminating single points of failure and improving scalability. Through real-time local logging and proactive metrics correlation, system administrators gain actionable insights into network health, enabling early intervention and efficient performance optimization.

## 🎯 Key Features

- Decentralized fault detection using heartbeat messages between neighboring nodes
- Real-time traffic logging to identify data flow bottlenecks
- Local log files (`node_status.txt`, `traffic_log.txt`) maintained per node
- Scalable, lightweight peer-to-peer monitoring architecture
- Secure communication using SSH and controlled file permissions
- High detection accuracy with minimal bandwidth and resource overhead

---

## ⚙️ Deployment Instructions

### 1. System Requirements

- OS: Linux-based system
- Utilities: `ping`, `ssh`, `scp`, `chmod`
- Password-less SSH enabled across all participating nodes

### 2. Setup & Execution

From the master node:

```bash
chmod +x deploy_peerguard.sh
./deploy_peerguard.sh
```

This script will:

- Deploy binaries and config files to all nodes
- Create the `peerguard_nodes.conf` with MAC/IP details
- Set proper permissions for monitoring logs

## 📊 Monitoring Components

### Heartbeat Monitoring

- Sends lightweight `ping` messages to immediate neighbors
- Uses a configurable threshold to reduce false positives during transient disruptions
- Generates `node_status.txt` with real-time reachability status

### Traffic Monitoring

- Logs inbound and outbound traffic data on each node
- Filters unreachable peers using data from `node_status.txt`
- Outputs metrics to `traffic_log.txt`

### Log File Integration

Logs are stored locally and updated periodically:

```bash
├── node_status.txt      # Reachability of neighboring nodes
├── traffic_log.txt      # Packet counts, traffic volume, and timestamps
```

## 🧪 Testing & Results

Tested using a simulated 8-node environment with varying workloads and network failures:

| Nodes | Avg Latency | Detection Accuracy | CPU Usage | Bandwidth Overhead              |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| 2     | 4 ms        | 99.5%              | 1.5%      | 0.2 KB/s (Heartbeat only)       |
| 8     | 10 ms       | 98.5%              | 3.0%      | 0.8 KB/s (HB), 2 KB/s (Traffic) |

> *HB = Heartbeat*

Performance includes tests under network partition scenarios and injected failures.

## 🔐 Security Measures

- All inter-node communication uses `scp` and password-less `ssh`
- Log files are protected using `chmod` for restricted write access
- Decentralized logging avoids single points of failure and reduces attack surface

---

## 📊 Experimental Results and Analysis

- Extensive experiments were conducted on simulated distributed environments to evaluate the runtime performance, fault detection accuracy, bandwidth usage, and scalability of PeerGuard.
- Testing scenarios included varying node counts, induced network partitions, and different heartbeat frequencies and thresholds.
- Detailed runtime logs, reachability trends, and bandwidth metrics were collected during each test phase.
- Visualizations of log outputs, node failure detection timelines, and traffic patterns are available upon request.
